about S1Engine:

if some important effects completely dissapear (blue\green glow on 1st boss of GLS) that means those are purely made out of shiny spinning particles eating the most FPS and which were disabled via MaxParticleResize=3 line in S1Engine, set value to 4 which'd enabled particles again (with the price of less FPS ofc)

if you need lightning effect on explosion skill on last of GLSH dungeon - remove FX_L_HotFix_150508.gpk mod file

if fullscreen stops working with it - edit resolution to your own in it ResX & ResY lines there using notepad

if textures becomes of rainbow\weird color - find and edit such line DirectionalLightmaps=true

if it crashes on launch - make sure you're not using mod for old character selection screen



also many UI mods can help you improve fps, especially lock-on cursor mod, damage numbers mods with scaling, and non-shaking bossbar ui mod - https://www.essentialmana.com/forums/#/discussion/7268/
